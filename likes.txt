Over the past six months, Richard Heart has emphasized graphic design that prioritizes bold, high-contrast visuals with a cyberpunk and futuristic aesthetic, incorporating sharp typography, neon accents, and minimalist layouts to evoke innovation and urgency. He favors meme-friendly elements like smug or expressive characters, cryptic symbols, and blockchain-inspired motifs (e.g., chains, hexagons, ledgers) that resonate with crypto communities, while maintaining clarity and shareability across platforms like X and Discord. Subtle nods to sigilkore’s occult-tinged vibe—distorted textures, dark palettes, and layered abstraction—are appreciated when paired with humorous or speculative narratives, especially in promotional teasers or community puzzles.
