ProveX OverviewProveX (formerly known as mrProve) is a decentralized verification protocol built on the PulseChain ecosystem, designed to enable trustless, on-chain proof-of-reserves and identity attestation for DeFi users, projects, and assets. Launched as a teaser in mid-2025, it addresses common blockchain transparency issues by allowing users to generate verifiable proofs of holdings, transaction histories, and compliance without revealing sensitive details, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy. Key features include: (1) Proof-of-Reserves Audits: Projects can submit encrypted snapshots of their treasuries, which smart contracts validate against public ledgers, displaying a "proven" badge on PulseX listings; (2) User Attestation: Individuals stake PLS to create portable identity proofs for KYC-lite access to dApps, reducing reliance on centralized verifiers; (3) Integration with PulseX: Native support for PLSX liquidity pools where proven tokens earn boosted yields via INC incentives; (4) Governance via $PROVEX Token: Holders vote on oracle integrations and proof standards, with a deflationary burn mechanism tied to verification fees. Richard Heart has described it as "the missing layer for PulseChain's maturity," emphasizing its role in attracting institutional capital by making audits "as easy as staking HEX." The protocol's sigilkore-inspired UI features neon-lit proof visualizations and meme-ified badges (e.g., smug frog icons for verified whales) to engage the crypto community. For full specs, visit provex.pulse or stake via the Pulse Wallet beta.
