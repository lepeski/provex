Web design competition. http://ProveX.com (site's not up yet.) $15,000, winner chosen in 24 hours. By entering and winning, you assign all rights to the anonymous donor who's choosing the winner and paying.

No external dependencies. The site must load perfectly offline and not auto update. Logo text is Avenir Next Bold (not demibold).

Even if it's not used, it's fun to see all the engagement.

Content quite similar to what you see in this post: https://x.com/RichardHeartWin/status/1986902194072002786

Not in the competition but free free to comment: What cool stuff would you like to see on a website that's really easy to do? What's the coolest web design you've seen recently?
